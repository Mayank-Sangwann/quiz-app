  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=' + 
      encodeURIComponent('https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX')
    );
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching quiz data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

🚧 Challenges & Solutions
❌ CORS Handling
Since the API had CORS restrictions, a CORS proxy (api.allorigins.win) was used to ensure seamless data fetching.

❌ Error Handling
Implemented robust error handling for:

API failures
Invalid responses
Data loading states
🚀 Future Improvements
🌟 Add timer functionality
🌟 Implement difficulty levels
🌟 Enhance UI animations
🌟 Save quiz progress
🌟 Improve analytics & reporting
